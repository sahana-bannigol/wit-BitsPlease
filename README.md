<h2><b>
What’s the problem?</b></h2>
There is a lot of e-waste produced which is not properly managed. It is treated as solid waste that incurs a loss in the valuable metals that could be acquired by recycling.
Hunger is another issue the whole world is facing which should be addressed and eliminated from its roots at the earliest.

<h2><b>How can technology help?</b></h2>
An app that can connect people to organizations that dispose of e-waste safely and responsibly. Therefore, e-waste can be collected in huge amounts compared to a process that lacks today’s technology.
Some people and organizations are trying their best to help in solving the issue of hunger but now is the time when we can use technology and make this process much easier and more hassle-free and impact a much larger audience.
Technology lies at the tip of your fingers. It’s just a click of a button, you can make this world a better place.

<h2>The idea!</h2>
An app that provides a service to pick up food and e-waste from one’s doorstep so that the food does not get wasted and can be given to the needy.

<h2>Long Description</h2>
There is no such thing as "away".  When we throw anything away it must go somewhere. One of the growing concerns to the global community is the management of e-waste. This is the direct result of needless overproduction of electronics which is increasing by the minute of the day. The extraction of valuable metals from e-waste is a way to recycle and use them again. In 2019, 53.6 million tonnes of electronics were discarded globally. Most people treat it as solid waste and feel that it is not convenient to separate them. Convenience at the cost of the planet is not convenient at all. The number of valuable metals that can be potentially extracted from the waste is lost. Our solution is to connect people with organizations that dispose of e-waste safely and responsibly. Eleos is an app that allows the user to dispose of e-waste by sending a volunteer to their doorstep. We will directly link the people to the organizations that efficiently dispose of e-waste.  

Eleos is also committed to addressing the issue of hunger. We're all conditioned to think that food in the dumpster is waste. But when you find bags of bread that are perfectly good, all of a sudden it turns into bounty. That's a huge shift in perception. The biggest challenges that our country faces are fragmented food systems and inefficient supply chains. This is the loss that occurs even before the food reaches the consumer. Excess food waste usually ends up in landfills, creating potent greenhouse gases which have dire environmental implications while we continue to be greenwashed into amassing more organic and sustainable products than what is needed. The current systems in the country fail to cope with the burden, subsequently leading to detrimental effects on the environment and public health. Open landfills lead to the production of methane, which absorbs the heat from the sun, warms the atmosphere, and contributes to global warming. Methane is also a primary cause of fire or explosions. Any change, even a change for the better is accompanied by discomfort. In our everyday lives, most of the time there is food left, uneaten and most of us throw it away as waste. Now, we as a community can reduce it with a simple click of a button. Instead of throwing away food that so many in the world aren’t privileged to acquire, we can click a button on the app. Someone will pick that left-over food and deliver it to the people who need it. Wherever there is a human in need, there is an opportunity for kindness and to make a difference. 
Our app provides a solution to two of the biggest problems – Wastage of Food and E-waste. This app Fills Two Needs with One Deed. We strive for clarity and ease of use across the board, from product design to communication to user experience. Simpler is smarter.

<h2>Project RoadMap</h2>
Our project currently has 2 main motives:
Collection of food
Collection of e-waste products
Food is collected and delivered to the needy.
E-waste is collected and handled safely within the authorized centres for recycling.

In future, we hope to partner up with restaurants, hotels, IT cells, electronic manufacturers, more authorized e-waste centres to spread our reach further.
In this way we shall ensure a large-scale chain of consumers/volunteers who can easily deliver their waste to the correct destination.
